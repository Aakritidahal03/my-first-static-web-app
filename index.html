We are <strong>Aakriti Dahal</strong> and <strong>Ichhya</strong>, two passionate students from Nepal currently pursuing our fourth semester in the <em>Computer Systems Technician – Networking (CSTN)</em> program at Canadore College in Mississauga, Canada. As enthusiastic learners in the field of technology, we are eager to explore web development, networking, and innovative digital solutions that connect people and ideas across the world. This project represents one of our collaborative efforts to apply classroom knowledge into real-world practice, enhance our technical skills, and showcase our creativity through designing and hosting a static web application
This is our first static web app hosted on Microsoft Azure using GitHub integration.</p>
